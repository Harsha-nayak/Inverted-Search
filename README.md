# Inverted-Search
The Inverted Search project implements an inverted index data structure in C, enabling efficient search capabilities over a collection of documents.

Inverted search, also known as an inverted index, is a fundamental technique in information retrieval systems. It allows users to quickly find documents containing specific terms by indexing the terms and mapping them to the documents where they appear. This project provides a basic implementation of an inverted index in C, demonstrating the core principles of information retrieval.
